We've noticed a lot of Ionic developers using Heroku side-by-side, either as a backend or to actually host their Ionic app as a mobile website or externally-loaded app.

To help with that, we've built a ready-to-go [Ionic app](https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-heroku-button) with Node.js and Express, to either host your Ionic app as a mobile website,
or to build a Node.js API server.

To get started, all you need to do is click the Heroku Deploy button below, or see the [manual instructions](https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-heroku-button) on the github repo:

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.png)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-heroku-button)

We hope this helps you get up and running with Ionic and a great backend like Heroku. Give it a spin, and let us know what you think!
